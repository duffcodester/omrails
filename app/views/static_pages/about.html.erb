<p>Welcome to the "about" page. Let me tell you a little bit about myself: </p>
<p>I am an Electrical Engineering (EE) student at Colorado School of Mines in my third year.
I have developed much interest in pursuing application development, and therefore enrolled myself
in a <a href="http://skillshare.com/">SkillShare</a> course in order to learn Ruby on Rails, 
aks "Rails." At any rate, welcome to my page...</p>
